                                Could you read it? Even with a mistake in this viral email (the letters in rscheearch cannot spell researcher), the truth is that most fluent English speakers can read and understand it.

                                The word-scrambling phenomenon has a punny name: typoglycemia, playing with typo and glycemia (the condition of having low blood sugar). Typoglycemia can refer to to the phenomenon in which words can be read despite being jumbles, or it can refer to the ability to read such texts. Still, though the word may sometimes be referenced in actual research, it’s not a formal term, nor is it all that commonly used outside the context of such memes.
                                <br>
                                Is typoglycemia real or a trick?<br>
                                Does it take you nanoseconds to solve a Word Jumble? No? While your brain can breeze through some word scrambles, it’s more complicated than that viral email suggests.
                                <br>
                                Matt Davis, a researcher at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at Cambridge University, helped us sort it out. Here’s what Davis believes the email got right: unless you have a rare brain disorder, people read words as whole units, not letter-by-letter. That’s one of the factors explaining why we can “magically” read the message.
                                <br>
                                There’s a reason we call them “sight words.” Here are some great sight word activities to help your child learn to read and write.

                                But here’s where Davis reminds us why the daily Word Jumble still manages to scramble our brains for breakfast. That trending email led us to believe all we need is for “the first and last letters to be in the right place” and nothing else matters. However, it’s much more complicated than that.

                                What makes a scrambled word easier to read?<br>
                                Here are some other factors a jumbled passage needs in order for most people to easily read it:
